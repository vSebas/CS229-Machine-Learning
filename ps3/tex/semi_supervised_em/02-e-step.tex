\item\subquestionpoints{5} \textbf{Semi-supervised E-Step.}
Clearly state which are all the latent variables that need to be re-estimated in the E-step. Derive the explicit GMM E-step for the semi-supervised setting to re-estimate all the stated latent variables. Your final E-step expression must only involve $x, z, \mu, \Sigma, \phi$ and universal constants.
