\item \subquestionpoints{5} Show that for any given split, the weighted Gini loss of the children can not exceed that of the parent. (\textbf{Hint}: first show that the Gini loss is strictly concave. And then use the fact that G is strictly concave meaning:
    \begin{align*}
        \forall p_1 \neq p_2, \forall t \in (0, 1): G(t p_1 + (1 - t) p_2) > t G(p_1) + (1 - t) G(p_2)
    \end{align*}
