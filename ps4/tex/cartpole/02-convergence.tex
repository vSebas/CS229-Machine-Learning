% \textbf{Convergence}
As the algorithm runs, it will print ``[INFO] Failure number \#\#\#'' each time the pole falls or cart goes out of bounds.
When the algorithm converges and stops, the final printed failure number indicates how many trials it took to converge.
Find the line of code that says \texttt{np.random.seed}, and rerun the code with the seed set to 1, 2, and 3.
